# 🌌 FluxWeave Studio  
> **AI-powered Brand Campaign Generator** — Build complete, consistent, multi-platform ad campaigns with one prompt.

---

## 🧠 Overview
**FluxWeave Studio** transforms how brands create and manage their marketing campaigns.  
Instead of juggling designers, photographers, and ad copywriters, FluxWeave uses AI to generate fully branded, platform-specific ads in minutes.

Upload your logo → describe your product → instantly get:
- Platform-specific visuals (Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Snapchat, X)
- Long-form persuasive captions  
- Brand-consistent color palette, tone, and mood  
- Lifestyle images with AI models wearing your products

FluxWeave takes a product from **concept → campaign → content** in one workflow.

## 🎯 Problem It Solves

FluxWeave Studio solves this by combining text and image AI models to:
- Maintain **brand consistency** automatically  
- Create **platform-tuned ads** in one click  
- Produce **AI lifestyle photos** for product marketing
